## Dataset
The Lappy Manage project obtained its laptop dataset from Kaggle, which contains information about various laptops, including brand, model, processor type, screen size, RAM, storage capacity, and price. The dataset was collected by the website PriceSpy in August 2020, with the goal of providing consumers with information about different laptop models and their prices. It is unclear who collected the raw data that PriceSpy used to compile the dataset, but it is likely that the data was gathered from various online retailers and laptop manufacturers.
